# openvino-docker

In this folder you need to include a pip wheel for the tensorflow installation and the openvino toolkit tgz file. Change names as needed in the Dockerfile.

The docker image will create a Ubuntu16.04 image able to run openVino code and running the tensorflow installation you provide with the wheel.
